  abstractNote = {A considerable proportion of the tremendous amount of material collected by the late Professor Harry Bateman concerns definite integrals. The organization and presentation of this material is a very difficult task to which Bateman devoted considerable attention. It is fairly clear that the arrangement used in shorter tables of integrals is not very suitable for a collection about three times the size of Bierens de Haan, and the circumstance that a considerable proportion of these integrals involves higher transcendental functions with their manifold and not always highly standardized notations, does not make this task easier. Eventually, Bateman decided to break up his integral tables into several more or less self-contained parts, classifying integrals according to their fields of application. A collection of integrals occurring in the theory of axially symmetric potentials was prepared, and other similar collections were to follow. Clearly such a plan involves a generous amount of duplication if the resulting tables are to be self-contained, but it also has great advantages from the user's point of view.},

    abstract = {Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport.Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation.At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 \% greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection.We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.},
