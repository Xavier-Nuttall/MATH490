  abstractnote = {A considerable proportion of the tremendous amount of material collected by the late Professor Harry Bateman concerns definite integrals. The organization and presentation of this material is a very difficult task to which Bateman devoted considerable attention. It is fairly clear that the arrangement used in shorter tables of integrals is not very suitable for a collection about three times the size of Bierens de Haan, and the circumstance that a considerable proportion of these integrals involves higher transcendental functions with their manifold and not always highly standardized notations, does not make this task easier. Eventually, Bateman decided to break up his integral tables into several more or less self-contained parts, classifying integrals according to their fields of application. A collection of integrals occurring in the theory of axially symmetric potentials was prepared, and other similar collections were to follow. Clearly such a plan involves a generous amount of duplication if the resulting tables are to be self-contained, but it also has great advantages from the user's point of view.},

  abstract = {Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport.Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation.At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 \% greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection.We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.},

  title     = {Contemporary wave–ice interaction models},
  abstract  = {Sea ice is an important indicator and agent of changes in the global climate system. The ice is affected by waves that travel into the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and cause floes to raft, deform and, potentially, fracture. The resulting change in the floe size distribution (FSD) influences the melting and freezing. Simultaneously, the ice floes affect the propagation of ocean waves. The motivation to study wave--ice interaction is therefore twofold: it plays a role in understanding climate change, and it is vital to wave forecasting models that have to be accurate to ensure the safety of research expeditions, coastal communities, etc. In the present thesis we investigate various models of ocean wave propagation in ice infested seas.
               
               We distinguish between three classes of models: "floe models", "effective medium models", and "transport equation models", each of which assume a different set of fundamental degrees of freedom. Our goal is to systematically explore existing models of each type and extend them to advance our understanding of wave-ice interactions.
               
               Floe models resolve individual ice floes as their fundamental degrees of freedom.  We consider the scattering of water waves in a two-dimensional domain from a floating sea ice floe of uncertain length. The length is treated as a random variable governed by a prescribed probability distribution. In accord with the majority of wave-ice interaction models, a thin elastic plate that floats with Archimedean draught is used to represent the ice floe. We compute the expectation and variance of the reflection and transmission coefficients using two different methods derived from the framework of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), which affords the expansion of unknown quantities of the problem in a basis of orthogonal polynomials of the random variable. The gPC methods are shown to be numerically efficient and exhibit desirable exponential convergence properties, as opposed to the slow algebraic convergence of the quasi Monte Carlo approach that we use for comparison. Finally, we employ one of the gPC methods to demonstrate that the FSD can have a significant impact on the expected transmission coefficient.
               
               Effective medium models describe the surface ocean layer (including ice floes, brash ice, etc.) as a homogeneous viscoelastic material that causes waves to attenuate as they travel through the medium. We compare three ice layer models, namely a viscoelastic fluid layer model currently being used for studies in the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III and two simpler viscoelastic thin beam models. A comparative analysis shows that one of the beam models provides similar predictions for wave attenuation and wavelength to the viscoelastic fluid model. We also calibrate the three models using wave attenuation data recently collected in the Antarctic MIZ. Although agreement with the data is obtained with all three models, several important issues related to the viscoelastic fluid model are identified that raise questions about its suitability to characterize wave attenuation in ice-covered seas. 
               
               Transport equation models describe the propagation of the wave action density (which is proportional to the wave energy density) in terms of a transport equation that is commonly used in ocean wave modelling. A term to represent the effect of floating sea ice is known for sparse collections of floes, but this is not valid at high concentrations. As a result, we derive the transport equation for a continuous ice cover of random thickness as a first step towards a transport equation model for high ice concentration. The attenuation coefficients predicted by this new equation turn out to be unrealistic. Hence, we outline an alternative derivation that may be explored in future work.},

  abstract = {In the present study, gravity wave interaction with a wave attenuating system (WAS) comprised of a series of surface piercing thin vertical porous plates fixed on a fully submerged rigid pontoon is analyzed. For the wave past porous barriers, a quadratic pressure drop is considered to account for the energy dissipation due to changes in wave steepness. A numerical model based on iterative multi-domain boundary element method is developed under the assumption of a small amplitude water wave theory. The scattering coefficients (reflection and transmission) and wave force coefficients (horizontal, vertical and moments) are computed for different wave and structural parameters such as the number of plates, relative plate width, the relative depth of submergence, plate porosities, and relative wave steepness. The results demonstrate that with the creation of trap zones through multiple porous plates on a submerged rigid pontoon, it is possible to reduce wave transmission by 60–70%. For optimum performance across all water depths, it is suggested for the WAS to have 1 ≤ B/h ≤ 1.5  and h1/h ≤ 0.3. Also, interestingly there is a 25–30% reduction in the vertical wave forces which reduces the load acting on the ancillary equipment. The WAS is found to perform well for porosity μ=20%, above which the wave transmission increases gradually. The study results can be useful in the cost-effective design of this type of special wave barrier for a range of coastal engineering field applications.}

  title     = {Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Water Wave Scattering by Floating Elastic Plates},
  abstract  = {The response of one or more floating compliant disks to a monochromatic linear water wave is investigated theoretically and experimentally, in a regime where scattering effects dominate. A model is constructed assuming the disks behave as thin elastic plates, moving freely in a fluid domain of finite depth and infinite extent in the horizontal directions. The response of a single disk is devised first, using a novel version of the eigenfunction matching method, that accommodates a realistic Archimedean draught. The solution to the multiple-disk problem is obtained using Graf’s addition formula.
               
               A unique series of wave tank experiments is reported that replicates as closely as possible the conditions of the model. An optical remote sensing device provides accurate measurements for the disk deflection. Theoretical and experimental data are compared in terms of the natural modes of vibration of the disk. The modal amplitudes are analysed for three different disk thicknesses, over a frequency range relevant to the regime of interest. Additional tests with two disks provide data for different spacings and angles between the disks.
               
               For tests involving a single disk, good agreement is obtained overall for the dominant modes, although discrepancies appear consistently in the results. The influence of components of the experimental setup are analysed theoretically by extension of the original model to explain or discard their effect on the motion of the disk. For tests with two disks, evidence that the disks influence each other’s motion is found and reasonable agreement is obtained with the theory.},

Here the problem is further investigated using an accurate method based on eigenfunction expansions. It is found that for sufficiently closely spaced barriers each zero of reflection is accompanied by a zero of transmission at a nearby frequency. As the barrier spacing is increased the two lowest frequency zeros of transmission coalesce and are lost. This loss of zeros of transmission in pairs continues as the barrier spacing is further increased.The effects of different barrier lengths and finite depth are also considered. For barriers of different lengths the zeros of reflection no longer occur while the existence of the zeros of transmission is unaffected.},

Problems are again formulated as hypersingular integral equations for the discontinuity in potential across the plate, which are then solved numerically using Chebyshev expansions and collocation. New results are given for submerged plates in the shape of a circular arc, and for surface-piercing plates at small angles of inclination to the horizontal. The latter configuration supports a hitherto unsuspected quasi-resonant behaviour, with a very spiky frequency response.}

  abstract = { We present a solution in the time-domain to the two-dimensional linear water-wave problem, in which a semi-infinite fluid region is bounded on one side by a vertical elastic plate. The problem is solved using a generalized eigenfunction expansion from the solutions for single frequencies, and we begin with a novel solution of the single-frequency problem. By formulating the problem using the acceleration potential, we find an inner-product space, in which the evolution operator with continuous spectrum is self-adjoint. This inner-product space is required for the generalized eigenfunction solution, which allows us to prescribe arbitrary initial water-surface and plate displacements and velocities. Furthermore, using the generalized eigenfunction expansion, the solution is approximated by deforming the contour of integration and using the contributions from the singularities of the analytic continuation. Numerical experiments show that the long-time behavior in certain situations can be closely approximated by this method. }

The boundary condition on the elastic plate is derived from the Bernoulli-Euler equation of motion satisfied by the plate. Using the Green's function technique, from this boundary condition, the normal velocity of the plate is expressed in terms of the difference between the velocity potentials (unknown) across the plate. The two ends of the plate are either clamped or free. The reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained in terms of the integrals'involving combinations of the unknown velocity potential on the two sides of the plate, which satisfy three simultaneous integral equations and are solved numerically.
